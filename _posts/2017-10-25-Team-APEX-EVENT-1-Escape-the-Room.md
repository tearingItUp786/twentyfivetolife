description: On Wednesday, October 25, 25toLife will be selling escape room vouchers. In partnership with our venue sponsor Locked Canada, each $5 donation will go to the Canadian Cancer Society. This will cover half of the regular admission price so you only need to pay the remaining half at the venue, saving you almost $8 per ticket! If you purchase a ticket voucher, your name will automatically be entered into a draw to either win one of two $50 SFU Bookstore gift cards or an exclusive Locked Canada prize package! Interested in sponsoring our event? Please contact our Sponsorship Coordinators at esccancer@gmail.com.
